Rocket.io is a realtime web application framework built on ruby. Rocket.io is unusual among web frameworks as it uses web sockets for almost everything.

To learn more about the concept behind Rocket, check out the screencast at [http://actsasbuffoon.com/blog/2011/08/25/rocket-dot-io-screencast/](http://actsasbuffoon.com/blog/2011/08/25/rocket-dot-io-screencast/).

The documentation is broken up into three sections, as you can see on the navigation panel to the left. The first is "Pages", which consists of notes, tips, tricks, and tutorials. The second is "Ruby Source", which is the annotated source code for the server framework. Last is "Javascript Source", which is the annotated client framework.

Rocket.io is a young project, and more documentation will be coming soon.
